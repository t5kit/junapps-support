    and are not uploaded or shared with the developer or any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Camera and Sensor Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Room Scan uses your device’s camera and sensors, including LiDAR (if available), solely to enable room scanning,
    measurement, and visualization features within the app.
    Camera and sensor data are used in real time and are not recorded, stored externally, or transmitted off the device.
