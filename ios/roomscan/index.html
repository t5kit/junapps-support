    Room Scan
  </h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Room Scan</strong> is a LiDAR-powered app that lets you scan real rooms and instantly view them as accurate 3D models. 
    Measure walls, floors, doors, windows, and furniture with just a few taps — no manual input required.
  </p>

  <h2>📋 App Description</h2>
  <p>
    Room Scan is a simple and intuitive room-scanning app designed for clarity and speed.
    Using your device’s LiDAR sensor, you can scan rooms and instantly view them in an interactive 3D model.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walls, floors, doors, windows, and furniture are automatically detected, allowing you to understand the structure of a space at a glance.
    You can freely rotate, zoom, and inspect the scanned room, and tap individual elements to highlight them and view details.
  </p>

  <p>
    All scanned rooms are saved locally and organized in a history list, making it easy to revisit past scans and manage multiple spaces.
    A sample room is included so you can explore all features before scanning your own environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app is fully usable without a subscription.
    With the Silver plan, detailed dimensions for rooms, walls, floors, and objects become visible, making it easier to plan layouts, renovations, or furniture placement.
    For advanced workflows, the Gold plan enables exporting scans as USDZ and JSON for use in other tools.
  </p>
