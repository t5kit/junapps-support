  <h1>📄 Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 14, 2025</p>
  <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile application <strong>“AR Measure + Notes”</strong> provided by the developer.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.  
    The app runs entirely on your device and does not send any data to external servers.  
    Your measurement photos, notes, and settings are stored locally on your device only.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Camera Usage</h2>
  <p>
    This app uses your device’s camera solely for the purpose of measuring distances using AR (augmented reality).  
    Camera input is processed locally and never transmitted outside your device.  
    No images or video from your camera are uploaded, stored externally, or shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    This app uses third-party services for advertising purposes. Specifically, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display banner ads.  
    AdMob may collect information such as device identifiers, approximate location, and user interaction with ads to provide personalized or non-personalized ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    For details on how Google handles user data, please refer to:<br/>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    <em>AR Measure + Notes</em> does not collect personal information from users of any age.  
    Because the app stores all measurement records locally and does not transmit data externally, it complies with child privacy regulations such as COPPA.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This policy may be updated periodically.  
    Any significant changes will be announced within the app or on the app’s distribution platform.
